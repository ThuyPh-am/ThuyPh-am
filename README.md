# 👋 Hi, I’m Thuy Pham

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a bit about me and what I'm passionate about:

## About Me
- 👀 Interested in AI/ML/DL and Lean principles, logistic/supply chain process optimization. Currently, obssessed with RL and advocated for Transformers
- 🎯 Recently, I start to grow interest in quantization methods for training and deploying models. And wondering maybe self-training is the way to go?! 🧐
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on projects on DL, RL, explainable ML and optimization training/deployment pipeline
- 📫 Let's connect and discuss opportunities to work together at Thuy.pham75016@gmail.com.

## My Journey
- 🎓 Pursuing a Master's in Information Engineering and Computer Science.
- 📚 A DL enthusiast, crafting innovative solutions with TensorFlow, PyTorch and Scikit-Learn, backed by a strong foundation in data mining and statistics.
- 🏔 Outside of work, I'm a podcast enthusiast and language explorer...shyly training for the first pull up 
- 💪🏽 Skilled in WMSs, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, mostly TF/ Keras and transforming to Pytorch Duh....ready to tackle AI's next frontier.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out for collaboration opportunities! 😊
