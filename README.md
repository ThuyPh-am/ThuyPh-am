# 👋 Hi, I’m Thuy Pham

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a bit about me and what I'm passionate about:

## About Me
- 👀 Interested in AI/ML/DL and Lean principles, logistic/supply chain process optimization. Currently, obssessed with RL and advocated for Transformers, of course
- 🌱 Logistics grad, exploring AI/ML/DL implementation in Logistics and passionate about Warehouse 5.0. Dreaming of a fully automatic warehouse with Robotics and RL
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on projects on DL, RL, and/or to optimize warehouse operations with the implementation of Lean principles and Warehouse 4.0 using AI/ML/DL.
- 📫 Let's connect and discuss opportunities to work together at Thuy.pham75016@gmail.com.

## My Journey
- 🎓 Graduated in Mobility and Logistics, now delving deep into DL and RL with a Master's in Information Engineering and Computer Science.
- 📚 Transitioning from Logistics, I'm now a DL enthusiast, crafting innovative solutions with TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, backed by a strong foundation in data mining and statistics.
- 💻 My goal? Leading the charge in ML and DL, driving transformative change in process optimization.
- 🏔 Outside of work, I'm a podcast enthusiast and language explorer...shyly training for the first pull up 
- 💪🏽 Skilled in WMSs, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, mostly TF but transforming to Pytorch Duh....ready to tackle AI's next frontier.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out for collaboration opportunities! 😊
